Hello there! 🛸

# Let me introduce myself
My name is Sebastian and I'm a student from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), who's currently studying plasma physics. 

I'm interested in:
- tokamaks and stellarators 🍩
- heliophysics 🌞
- beautiful images of plasmas 📸

This GitHub account was created in order to contain all the scripts and simulations that I develop through my studies. 

# Current focus
Visualization of the numerical and analytical solutions of MHD equations in plasma physics. For this reason I decided to start with a little bit of self-study of classical fluid mechanics and of CFD. The idea is to get a grasp of the plasma behaviour, which is un-intuitive, because I do not interact with plasmas in my every day life...

# Available repositories
Currently, there are only two repositories available:
- [CFD](https://github.com/Grafton17/CFD) on Computational (neutral) Fluid Dynamics 🌊
- [Lab_Courses](https://github.com/Grafton17/Lab_Courses): useful procedures and algorithms for the analysis of data from cold ❄️ (turbulence, coherent structures, linear waves, bi-linear waves) and hot 🔥 (LaBr3:Ce scintillator detectors) plasmas.

<!--
**Grafton17/Grafton17** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
