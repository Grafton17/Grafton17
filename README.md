## Hello there! ðŸ›¸

My name is Sebastian and I'm a student from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), who's currently studying plasma physics. This GitHub account was created in order to contain all the scripts and simulations that I develop through my studies. 

Currently interested in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Plasma Science (CPS).
