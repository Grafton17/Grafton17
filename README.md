## Hello there! 🛸

# Let me introduce myself
My name is Sebastian and I'm a student from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), who's currently studying plasma physics. 

I'm interested in:
- tokamaks and stellarators 🍩
- heliophysics 🌞
- beautiful images of plasmas 📸

This GitHub account was created in order to contain all the scripts and simulations that I develop through my studies. 

# Current focus
Visualization of the numerical and analytical solutions of MHD equations in plasma physics. For this reason I decided to start with a little bit of self-study of classical fluid mechanics and of CFD. The idea is to get a grasp of the plasma behaviour, which is un-intuitive, because I do not interact with plasmas in my every day life...
